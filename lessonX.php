					javascript:sayText("Breast cancer is a kind of cancer caused by tumors forming in the tissues of the breast. Breast cancer usually forms in the lobules, which contain glands that make milk, or in the ducts that lead from the lobules to the nipple. Among women, breast cancer is the second most common form of cancer after skin cancer, and causes the second most deaths after lung cancer. However, with treatment breast cancer is not fatal for most women. While breast cancer can occur in men it is extremely rare and the vast majority of breast cancers affect women. Thus we will focus on breast cancer in women for this lesson. The base rate for breast cancer among women is 12.2%, though some women face increased risk.",3,1,3);

Malignant tumors are cancerous and can spread to other parts of the body. They can be removed but can sometimes grow back. Malignant tumors can become life-threatening.",3,1,3);

					javascript:sayText("Most breast cancer forms in the ducts and is called ductal carcinoma. Cancer that forms in the lobes is lobular carcinoma and is more dangerous, but rarer. Both the ducts and lobes connect to blood vessels and lymph nodes that lead to other areas of the body. Cancer can travel through the blood and lymph nodes to reach other areas of the body and start growing in new locations. Cancer can also spread through other surrounding tissues. The more cancer has spread through the body, the more serious and dangerous the cancer is. The process of cancer spreading to other parts of the body is called metastasis. Metastasis becomes deadly when it spreads to vital organs and stops them from functioning. Cancer that has metastasized remains the same type of cancer as the original tumor. Thus breast cancer that spreads to the lungs is still breast cancer, not lung cancer.",3,1,3);

Stage 1 breast cancer has invaded healthy areas of the breast, but has not spread beyond the breast. At this point cancer is usually treated easily and almost all people survive. Stage 2 cancer is when a tumor begins to grow larger without spreading or when a small tumor starts to spread to the lymph nodes. Stage 3 cancer is locally spread, which means it has begun to spread outside the breast to areas such as the chest wall, lymph glands, or breast bone, but has not spread further. Risk at Stage 3 is high, but with treatment most still survive. Stage 4 cancer is metastatic and has spread to other parts of the body such as the bone, lung, and liver. At this stage risk of death becomes much higher.",3,1,3);

Other risk factors are not easily avoided, such as the risk that comes from having a child at an older age, having an early first menstrual period, or going through menopause at a late age. Some unavoidable risk factors indicate the possibility of genetic risk, or risk caused by having genes that make it more likely for breast cancer to occur. Genes are sections of DNA that have the information needed to make cells work and give each person their traits. Half of your genes come from your mother and half from your father. Gene mutations can lead to harmful permanent changes in the DNA of genes that continue to be passed on from generation to generation.",3,1,3);

Having a first-degree relative (such as a mother, sister, or daughter) or second-degree relative (such as a grandmother, aunt, or cousin) with breast cancer increases your risk of getting breast cancer. This risk is higher if a family member had cancer before the age of fifty or if multiple family members had breast cancer. Having a relative with ovarian cancer also is a risk factor. Because breast cancer in men is rare, having a male relative with breast cancer is a very high risk factor. However, having family members with other cancers (such as skin or lung cancer) is not a risk factor for breast cancer.",3,1,3);

For example, women who are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent have been found to be at increased risk for genetic mutations that can lead to breast cancer. In fact, Ashkenazi Jewish heritage alone can be considered enough to put a woman at medium risk even if no other genetic risk factors are present. Women of European descent are also at slightly increased risk compared to women of different backgrounds, though this risk is typically only taken into consideration alongside other risk factors. However, the biggest risk factor for breast cancer for all women is age. Most women are over sixty years old when they are first diagnosed with breast cancer.",3,1,3);

However, mutations in these genes are very rare. Only about 1% of women in the United States have a mutation in BRCA 1 or BRCA 2, and mutations in these genes account for only about 5 to 10% of all breast cancer. In fact most women who have risk factors such as a family history of breast cancer still do not have BRCA mutations. The proportion of women with genetic risk has remained relatively stable over the past two decades.",3,1,3);

However, when these genes have a harmful mutation they cannot function properly and cells can grow uncontrollably leading to cancer-causing tumors. Having a BRCA mutation does not necessarily mean that a person will develop breast cancer. However their risk is about five times that of the average person. Between 55 and 80% of women with a harmful mutation will develop breast cancer.",3,1,3);

The absolute risk for most women is about 12.2%, but this risk is higher for women with harmful BRCA mutations. Another way to measure risk is relative risk. Relative risk compares certain risk factors. For example, a woman with a harmful BRCA mutation has about a 60% chance of getting breast cancer, which is a 48% increase in absolute risk compared to the average woman, but because it is five times as much it represents a 500% increase in relative risk. Risk can also be measured as 5-year risk, which represents the chances of getting breast cancer within the next five years. This risk is almost zero for all women at young ages, but increases as they get older because age is the biggest risk factor for breast cancer.",3,1,3);

The Gail Model incorporates a womans current age, her age during her first menstrual period, her age when her first child was born, the number of her first-degree relatives who have had breast cancer, her own personal history of breast cancer and breast biopsies, and her race or ethnicity. There are genetic tests that can determine if a woman has a mutation in her BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 genes and is at increased risk of breast cancer. Speaking with a genetic counselor can help a woman decide if it makes sense for her to be tested for genetic risk. A genetic counselor can help explain what risk factors a woman has and help interpret a test if one is performed.",3,1,3);

It is important to note that this does not mean that she currently has breast cancer, only that she is more likely than the average woman to get breast cancer, though it is not guaranteed that she will. A negative test result, meaning there is not a mutation, means she is at no greater risk than the general population. This means that she may still get breast cancer at some time in her life, but only has the same 12.2% risk that the average woman has.",3,1,3);

If a woman knows she is at increased risk she can take actions to increase the chance of surviving breast cancer. She can engage in increased active surveillance to detect breast cancer at its earliest when it is most easily treatable. This can include more frequent breast-exams and mammograms.",3,1,3);

However, while these methods reduce risk they do not guarantee that cancer will not develop, as not all breast tissue can be removed and the drugs are not 100% effective. Drugs like Tamoxifen also have several potentially serious side effects that a woman may wish to avoid, including strokes, blood clots, and early symptoms of menopause.",3,1,3);

One reason is that the test also provides information about other family members, and some family members may not want to know about their risk. The price of testing can also be expensive and is not covered by many insurance plans. A positive test result may also make a woman worry about her future because she knows of her increased risk, while a negative test result may make a woman incorrectly feel she never will have to worry about breast cancer. There is also a chance of illegal genetic discrimination if a positive test result does not remain private.
